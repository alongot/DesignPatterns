Binary Search Tree Visualizer
A simple interactive visualizer for Binary Search Trees (BST) built with Python and wxPython. This tool allows users to insert nodes, search for values, and view tree traversals (In-order and Pre-order). The tree structure is drawn dynamically, and nodes are color-coded to provide visual feedback.

Features
Insert Nodes: Insert values into the binary search tree by typing them into a text box and pressing Enter.

Visual Traversals: Perform and visualize In-order and Pre-order traversals, with nodes highlighted as they are visited.

Search for Values: Search for a specific value in the tree and highlight the node if it is found.

Reset Tree: Clear the tree and start fresh.
